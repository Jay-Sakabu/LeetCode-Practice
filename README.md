# LeetCode Practice

This repository contains solutions to practice problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), focusing on data structures and algorithms. Most solutions will be implemented in Python, with occasional solutions also made in C.

## Why Python ***and*** C?
Python is used because it allows for a quick and relatively simple route for solving problems. Its rich library and native support for complex data types make it hassle-free to manipulate and transform data as needed.

C, on the other hand, requires more deliberate design (especially for more complex problems). It lacks many of Python's built-in convenient functionality. Because of this, programming in C encourages deeper thinking about data-handling and requires more intention from the developer.

## Contents

- Data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, etc.)
- Algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.)
- Well-commented code for learning and reference

## Purpose

To improve problem-solving skills and deepen understanding of core Python and C functionality while also familiarizing myself with more complex data-structures and algorithms.
